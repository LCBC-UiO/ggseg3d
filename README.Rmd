This package mainly contains a plotting function `ggseg3d` and data.frames of different brain atlases for plotting.
Plotting results of analyses on regions or networks often involves swapping between statistical tools, like R and Matlab, 
and software for brain imaging to correctly visualise analysis results.

This package aims to make it possible to plot results directly through R. 

## Atlases
There are currently four atlases available in the package:  

1. `dk_3d` - Desikan-Killany atlas (aparc).   
2. `aseg_3d` - Automatic subcortical segmentation.  

We are working on creating a detailed description in the wiki on how to create and contribute atlases to the package.
The `ggseg3d` function already allows you to provide it with a data.frame of a custom atlas if you have it, but is must
correspond to certain specifications to work.

Please see the [wiki](https://github.com/LCBC-UiO/ggseg/wiki/Creating-and-contributing-atlases) for information on adding atlases, or inspect the included datasets for requirements. 
If anything is unclear in the wiki, give us a shout out in the issues!

You may find more atlases in the companion package [ggsegExtra](https://github.com/LCBC-UiO/ggsegExtra).

## Installation
The package can be installed using {remotes}. The package includes some large datasets for the brain coordinates. Please be patient during download and install, it will take some time.

```{r eval=F}
install.packages("remotes")
remotes::install_github("LCBC-UiO/ggseg3d", build_vignettes = TRUE)
```

The functions are now installed, and you may load them when you want to use them.
All functions are documented in standard R fashion.

## Use
The package also has a vignette, to help you get started using it. 
You can access it [here](https://lcbc-uio.github.io/ggseg3d/ggseg3d.html), or via R:

```{r eval=F}
library(ggseg3d)
vignette("ggseg3d")
```

```{r results='hide'}
p <- ggseg3d(atlas=dk_3d) %>% 
  remove_axes() %>% 
  pan_camera("right lateral")
```
```{r, echo=FALSE}
p <- p %>% 
  plotly::add_annotations( text="Screen capture",
                  legendtitle=TRUE, showarrow=FALSE,
                  font = list(color = 'darkgrey',
                              family = 'sans serif',
                              size = 50)) 
plotly::orca(p, "man/img/README-dk_3d-plot.png")
knitr::include_graphics("man/img/README-dk_3d-plot.png")
```


```{r results = 'hide'}
p <- ggseg3d(atlas=aseg_3d) %>% 
  add_glassbrain() %>% 
  remove_axes() %>% 
  pan_camera("right lateral")
```
```{r, echo = FALSE}
p <- p %>% 
  plotly::add_annotations( text="Screen capture",
                  legendtitle=TRUE, showarrow=FALSE,
                  font = list(color = 'darkgrey',
                              family = 'sans serif',
                              size = 50)) 
plotly::orca(p, "man/img/README-aseg_3d-plot.png")
knitr::include_graphics("man/img/README-aseg_3d-plot.png")
```

### Report bugs or requests  
Don't hesitate to ask for support using [github issues](https://github.com/LCBC-UiO/ggseg3d/issues), or requesting new atlases. 
While we would love getting help in creating new atlases, you may also request atlases through the issues, and we will try to get to it.
